## ASNA.Helpers.Routing

This class library provides three classes:

 *	Router
 *	Controller
 *	RouteAction 
	
Which all work together to let you create a RESTful-style routed application. It was designed to provide the same kind of routing that Microsoft's [ASP.NET Routing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx) provides.

This version is not production ready, but it is very close. Although this is a  work-in-progress  a full example is [available here](https://github.com/ASNA/AVR-CRUD-Single-Page-App.) See that example for more details and documentation.
